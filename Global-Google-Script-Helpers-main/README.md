# Global Helpers (Google Apps Script)

This is a simple library that contains a number of useful universal methods. Methods are grouped according to the type of data that is passed in (ie if a method requires a string argument, it is located in the `String.js` file).

## Setup

To add this library to your script file, do the following in the Apps Script code editor:

1. Click on the menu item "Resources > Libraries..."
2. In the "Add a Library" text box, enter the script ID `1DsCgJGt-kX56V2cCf6_4Mj5oMDyzYETmqkdr-XsLvQHRfI8BEMBHFiT2` and click the "Add" button.
3. Choose a version in the dropdown box (usually best to pick the latest version).
4. Click the "Save" button.

In the _new_ editor:

1. Click on the plus sign next to _Libraries_
2. In the _Script ID_ text box, enter the script ID `1DsCgJGt-kX56V2cCf6_4Mj5oMDyzYETmqkdr-XsLvQHRfI8BEMBHFiT2` and click the "Lookup" button.
